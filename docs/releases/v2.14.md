## 🎙️ Audio File Support

### 1. Native Audio Input (Gemini)
- **Direct Processing**: You can now upload audio files directly to **Gemini 1.5 Pro / Flash** models.
- **Multimodal Understanding**: Gemini can listen to the audio and answer questions, summarize content, or analyze tone directly from the raw audio data.
- **Supported Formats**: WAV, MP3, AIFF, AAC, OGG, FLAC.

### 2. Universal Audio Support via SST (Speech-to-Text)
- **For Non-Audio Models**: Models that don't support audio natively (like **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, **GPT-4o**, or Local LLMs) can now "hear" your audio files.
- **Transcribe Modal**: When you upload an audio file to these bots, a "Transcribe" dialog appears.
- **Transcription Engines**:
  - **OpenAI Whisper**: High-accuracy transcription (requires OpenAI API key).
  - **Gemini**: Cost-effective transcription using your existing Gemini bots.
- **Workflow**: The audio is transcribed to text, and the text is sent to the bot as context, allowing you to "chat" about the audio with any model.

### 3. Audio Player & UI
- **Inline Player**: Uploaded audio files are displayed with a sleek inline audio player in the chat history.
- **File Preview**: Click on an audio attachment to preview it and see its transcription (if available).
