## 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Replicate Seedream Fix**: Fixed an issue where the Novita-specific URL path was incorrectly applied to Replicate Seedream models, causing 404 errors. Added a generic fallback for Replicate models to prevent future issues.
- **Gemini Tool Schema**: Implemented `sanitizeSchema` to remove non-standard fields like `x-order` and `title` from tool definitions, which were causing `400 Bad Request` errors in Gemini API.
- **OpenAI Tool Format**: Updated tool conversion to support a hybrid format (name at top level) to improve compatibility with certain OpenAI-compatible providers (like GPT-5 preview endpoints).

# Release Notes - Audio Support & Speech-to-Text

## Version: v2.14.0
**Release Date:** 2025-12-17
**Base:** v2.13.9
**Highlights:** Added comprehensive Audio File Support. Gemini models now support native audio input, while other models gain audio compatibility via a built-in Speech-to-Text (SST) transcription feature.

## 🎙️ Audio File Support

### 1. Native Audio Input (Gemini)
- **Direct Processing**: You can now upload audio files directly to **Gemini 1.5 Pro / Flash** models.
- **Multimodal Understanding**: Gemini can listen to the audio and answer questions, summarize content, or analyze tone directly from the raw audio data.
- **Supported Formats**: WAV, MP3, AIFF, AAC, OGG, FLAC.

### 2. Universal Audio Support via SST (Speech-to-Text)
- **For Non-Audio Models**: Models that don't support audio natively (like **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, **GPT-4o**, or Local LLMs) can now "hear" your audio files.
- **Transcribe Modal**: When you upload an audio file to these bots, a "Transcribe" dialog appears.
- **Transcription Engines**:
  - **OpenAI Whisper**: High-accuracy transcription (requires OpenAI API key).
  - **Gemini**: Cost-effective transcription using your existing Gemini bots.
- **Workflow**: The audio is transcribed to text, and the text is sent to the bot as context, allowing you to "chat" about the audio with any model.

### 3. Audio Player & UI
- **Inline Player**: Uploaded audio files are displayed with a sleek inline audio player in the chat history.
- **File Preview**: Click on an audio attachment to preview it and see its transcription (if available).

## 🛠️ Improvements

- **Input Handling**: Drag-and-drop support for audio files in the chat input area.
- **SST Service**: New internal service `sst-service` to handle transcription logic abstractly across providers.
- **Attachment Preview**: Enhanced preview modal to support audio playback alongside text content.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **New Permissions**: No new host permissions required (uses existing OpenAI/Gemini access).
- **Files**: Added `src/services/sst-service.ts`, `src/app/components/Chat/TranscribeModal.tsx`.
- **Refactoring**: Updated `file-processor.ts` to handle audio MIME types and validation logic.

## 📦 Summary

v2.14.0 bridges the gap between multimodal and text-only models, ensuring that **Audio** is a first-class citizen in HuddleLLM regardless of which AI provider you prefer.
