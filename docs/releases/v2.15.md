## Gemini Image Improvements

### Inline Image Fix
- Fixed a bug where Gemini-generated inline images were only captured from the **first streaming chunk**. Images are now correctly collected from all chunks and converted to blob URLs for display.

### Open Image in New Tab
- Clicking on any AI-generated image in the chat now opens it in a **new browser tab**, making it easier to view in full resolution or save.

---

## Provider Info in Chatbot Tooltip

- The chatbot name tooltip now displays the resolved **Provider name** and **API Scheme**.
- Makes it easy to verify which provider and API format each bot is actually using (especially when using `providerRefId`).

---

## UI Updates

- **PDF Icon**: The attachment button now shows a dedicated red PDF icon when cycling to PDF mode.
- **Blob URL Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup for image and audio blob URLs in the chat message card to prevent memory leaks.
